# sctk_gtk

GTK style sctk frame

This crates aim to provide GTK style sctk frame

consider GNOME Wayland doesn't provide SSD(server side decoration), using GTK to draw the frame maybe the only way to
let window title looks like native

thanks for sctk-adwaita project, sctk_gtk learn many thing from it

## features

- [x] GTK style frame
- [x] GTK style shadow (just learn from sctk-adwaita directly)
- [ ] GTK style rounded corner
- [ ] GTK style button animation (yes, GTK head bar button has animation)
